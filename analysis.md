## Layer 2, Head 5

This attention head appears to focus on the relationship between verbs and their direct objects. When analyzing the attention patterns, it became evident that the head often places strong attention weights on the objects that follow transitive verbs. This suggests that the model has learned to associate verbs with their corresponding objects, reinforcing their syntactic and semantic connection.

Example Sentences:
- The cat chased the mouse.
- She wrote a letter.


## Layer 6, Head 8

This attention head appears to focus on the relationship between pronouns and their antecedents. The head frequently attends to the noun or proper noun that a pronoun refers to, helping the model resolve coreference relationships. This is crucial for maintaining coherence and understanding long-range dependencies in sentences.

Example Sentences:
- John went to the store because he needed milk.
- The teacher called Sarah since she forgot her homework.
